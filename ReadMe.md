# Hospital / Healthcare Management System

---

## Project Overview
### Advanced | Time Estimate: 10–12 hours

This phase transforms the Hospital Management System into a **Spring Boot web application**. It focuses on building **RESTful and GraphQL APIs** that interact with the underlying database while applying enterprise-level backend concepts such as validation, exception handling, AOP, and OpenAPI documentation.

The system models real-world hospital operations including **patients, doctors, departments, and appointments**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean architecture.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

* Apply Spring Boot configuration principles, IoC, and Dependency Injection for modular applications.
* Develop RESTful APIs using layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
* Implement validation, exception handling, and API documentation using Bean Validation, @ControllerAdvice, and Springdoc OpenAPI.
* Integrate GraphQL schemas, queries, and mutations for flexible data retrieval.
* Apply AOP and algorithmic techniques for logging, monitoring, sorting, searching, and pagination.
