# Hospital Management System – Advanced
---

## Project Overview
### Advanced | Time Estimate: 10–12 hours

This phase enhances the existing Hospital Management System by integrating **Spring Data JPA** and advanced persistence techniques. The focus is on repository abstraction, query optimization, transaction management, pagination, sorting, and caching.

Learners will implement derived queries, custom JPQL and native SQL queries, and apply transactional boundaries while improving system performance compared to the previous module.

---

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

* Use Spring Data JPA to simplify database access via repository interfaces.
* Implement CRUD operations, pagination, and sorting.
* Manage transactions using @Transactional (propagation, isolation, rollback).
* Create custom JPQL and native SQL queries.
* Apply caching using Spring Cache to improve performance.
* Optimize searching, filtering, and retrieval logic.
