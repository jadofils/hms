# Hospital/Healthcare Management System 

---

## Project Overview

This phase of the Hospital Management System focuses on enhancing system performance, responsiveness, and scalability through asynchronous programming, efficient concurrency management, and performance profiling.

Learners will extend their previously secured backend to apply asynchronous programming techniques, refactor slow or blocking operations, and use profiling tools and performance metrics to evaluate system efficiency.

Students will analyze API execution patterns, apply DSA-based optimization strategies, and document their findings through measurable results tested via Postman or any frontend.

---

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, learners will be able to:

* Apply asynchronous programming patterns (`CompletableFuture`, `ExecutorService`) to improve API responsiveness.
* Analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks using profiling and metrics-based performance reports.
* Implement concurrency and parallel processing techniques to handle high-load operations efficiently.
* Apply DSA concepts (thread-safe collections, queues, sorting, caching) for high-performance data handling.
* Evaluate and document system improvements using execution time comparisons and resource utilization metrics.

## Epics and User Stories

### Epic 1: Performance Bottleneck Analysis

**User Story 1.1**
As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks in my secured backend so that I can understand where optimizations are needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Profiling performed using a suitable tool (e.g., VisualVM, JProfiler, or Java Flight Recorder).
* Bottlenecks identified in database access, service logic, or API response time.
* Baseline performance metrics recorded for comparison.

**User Story 1.2**
As a system analyst, I want to generate a report of identified bottlenecks so that optimization efforts are data-driven.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Metrics include CPU usage, memory footprint, and response latency.
* Findings documented with screenshots or summary data.
* Report stored as part of deliverables.

### Epic 2: Asynchronous Programming Implementation

**User Story 2.1**
As a backend developer, I want to implement asynchronous request handling so that API responses are non-blocking and efficient.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Long-running operations refactored using `CompletableFuture` or parallel streams.
* APIs remain responsive during concurrent requests.
* Thread pools configured for optimal performance.

**User Story 2.2**
As a QA engineer, I want to test concurrent API requests so that I can verify system stability under load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Multiple API calls executed in parallel.
* No data inconsistency or race conditions observed.
* Response times compared before and after optimization.

### Epic 3: Concurrency and Thread Safety

**User Story 3.1**
As a developer, I want to use thread-safe data structures so that concurrent operations don't cause data corruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Use of concurrent collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`).
* Shared resources protected using synchronization only where necessary.
* Thread safety verified through concurrent test cases.

**User Story 3.2**
As a performance engineer, I want to balance concurrency levels so that I can optimize throughput without overwhelming resources.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Executor configurations tested with varying thread pool sizes.
* CPU and memory utilization monitored during stress testing.
* Optimal configuration documented and justified.

### Epic 4: Data and Algorithmic Optimization

**User Story 4.1**
As a developer, I want to improve data access and manipulation efficiency so that the system performs better under heavy load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Critical operations refactored with efficient algorithms.
* Caching or indexing enhanced using hash-based lookups.
* Time complexity analyzed and documented.

**User Story 4.2**
As an analyst, I want to measure the impact of algorithmic changes so that performance gains are quantifiable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Before-and-after execution times compared.
* Metrics summarized in a performance report.
* Charts or tables provided.

### Epic 5: Metrics Collection and Reporting

**User Story 5.1**
As a developer, I want to collect runtime metrics so that I can evaluate system behavior under load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Metrics collected for latency, memory usage, and throughput.
* Data visualized or summarized.
* Profiling integrated into workflow.

**User Story 5.2**
As a project reviewer, I want to see evidence of optimization so that I can validate effectiveness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Performance report submitted with results.
* Documentation includes screenshots and summary conclusions.
* Improvements demonstrated during testing.
